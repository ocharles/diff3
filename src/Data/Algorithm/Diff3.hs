-- | A hunk is a collection of changes that occur in a document. A hunk can be
-- some changes only in A, only in B, in both A & B (equally), or conflicting
-- between A, B and the original document.  All hunks take 3 constructors, which
-- are, in order - the elements in the left document, the original document, and
-- the right document. This order matches the order of parameters to 'diff3'.
--
-- For 'Unchanged', contains the value from both A, the original, and B, in
-- case you are using a form of equality that doesn't check all data (see
-- 'Diff').
